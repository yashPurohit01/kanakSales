Well, theres a good reason for it.The reason we stay loyal to brands is because of their values.The best brands combine physical, emotional, and logical elements into one exceptional customer(and employee) experience that you value as much as they do. When your brand creates a genuine connection with customers and employees, they'll stay loyal to your company, thereby increasing your overall profitability. According to a Circular Board article, 74% of consumers say theyâ€™re loyal to a brand due to its product quality."
